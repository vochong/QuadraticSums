""" This program can be used to calculate value of a/b
to arbitrary precision for any two given integers a and b provided
that gcd(10,b/gcd(a mod b,b)) = 1  If gcd(a mod b,b) = 1 then this
is equivalent to requiring that gcd(10,b) = 1
There are two main functions in this program:
(1) divide(a,b,n1) which calculates a/b to n1 decimal digits of precision
(2) digits(a,b,n1,n2) which calculates the n1 to n2 digits in the fractional
part of the decimal expansion of a/b
The function digits is efficient even if n1 is a large integer provided that
n2 - n1 is reasonably small.  Other division algortihms such trial division
or Newton-Raphson are not efficient or computationally feasible for large
values of n1.  The output of both functions is returned as a string.
See the comments in front of the definitions of both of the functions divide
and digits below for more information """

algorithm runs O(n log n (log b)^2 + n (log b)^3) time.  Also it should be
noted that algorithm runs efficiently even if n1 is a very large integer.

integer then digits(a,b,n1,n1+n) could be quickly and efficiently calculated in
O(n log n1 (log b)^2 + n (log b)^3) time.  With previous subtractive or
