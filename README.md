The papers file contains three different versions of the paper "On Calculating Square Roots in GF(p)" versions 2, 2.1 and 3.
Version 2.1 is essentially the same as version 2 but with several typographical errors corrected.  Version 3 is the latest version and has a new section 5.2 on cubic reciprocity that has been added.
